Examine the impact of perceptual and its alternatives loss on different computer vision tasks and methods.

- GLO: Train a generative model in the GLO method using perceptual distance 
- Adobe2AFC: test different perceptual losses on the Adobe2AFC
- perceptual_mean_optimization: find the mean of a set of images according to different perceptual distance metrics
- perceptualKmeans: cluster datasets using kmeans while using perceptual distance metrics
